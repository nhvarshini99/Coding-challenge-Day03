## Quality Control Dashboard 
## Scenario:  
You're a junior data analyst at a manufacturing company. The production manager has asked 
you to create a Quality Control Dashboard to monitor and identify key areas of concern. They 
want a clear, interactive way to track product defects. 
## Your Task:  
Using a dataset that contains production and quality inspection data, you need to create a one
page Power BI report that answers the following questions: 
1. What is our overall defect rate? This needs to be a prominent metric on the dashboard. 
2. Which products have the highest number of defects? The manager wants to easily see 
the top 5 most problematic products. 
3. Is the defect rate improving or worsening over time? You need to show a trend of the 
defect rate over the last year. 
4. Are certain inspection batches performing worse than others? You need a way to 
analyze defects by production batch. 
Data Provided: You will be given a file (e.g., Excel or CSV) with two tables: 
• Production: Contains ProductID, BatchID, Date, and Status (Pass or Fail). 
• Batches: Contains BatchID, ProductionLine, and InspectorName.
